### TODO List for this project

I think I want to work backwards - starting with the Python wrapper first and writing the network last.
Just in case something specific needs to be done in the C++ code.
Also because I'll be using a pickle file that has the MNIST training and testing data stored already lol.
- [ ] create Python wrapper to basic C++ code that prints first 5 elements of the np array
- [ ] update matrix code to use the arrays as the float* parts of the Matrix class
- [ ] create neural network
- [ ] create Python file to test this stuff
